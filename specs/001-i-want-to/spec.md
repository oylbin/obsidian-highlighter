# Feature Specification: Text Highlighter for Obsidian

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`
**Created**: 2025-09-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want to create a simple obsidian plugin that can add or remove html markup around user selected text to make it highlight with specific background color. There should be some predefined colors that can use as background color while users can also add the colors they want in the plugin's setting page. Users can select text in obsidian editor and then click right button of the mouse to get the menu; In the menu, there should be menu items like: `Highlight with xxx`, `xxx` is the colors defined/added in its setting page. and one more menu item 'Erease highlight'."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature: Text highlighting plugin for Obsidian
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Obsidian users
   ‚Üí Actions: Select text, apply/remove highlights
   ‚Üí Data: Color definitions, highlighted text
   ‚Üí Constraints: Right-click context menu integration
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Marked clarifications needed for color defaults and limits
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary user flow: Select text ‚Üí Right-click ‚Üí Choose highlight
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Text selection and highlighting requirements defined
   ‚Üí Settings management requirements specified
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Highlight colors and highlighted text segments
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties regarding default colors and limits"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an Obsidian user, I want to highlight important text passages with colored backgrounds so that I can visually emphasize and quickly locate key information in my notes.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has selected text in the Obsidian editor, **When** they right-click on the selection, **Then** a context menu appears with highlight color options
2. **Given** text is already highlighted with a color, **When** the user selects that text and chooses "Erase highlight", **Then** the highlight markup is removed
3. **Given** the user is in the plugin settings, **When** they add a new custom color, **Then** that color appears as an option in the right-click context menu
4. **Given** the user has multiple predefined colors, **When** they right-click on selected text, **Then** all available colors appear as separate menu items
5. **Given** highlighted text exists in a note, **When** the note is viewed in reading mode, **Then** the highlights are visible with their respective background colors

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user selects text that is partially highlighted?
    - The plugin should try to find the whole highlighted text block and then act as user select the whole block.
- How does system handle nested highlights (highlight within a highlight)?
    - Do not allow add nested highlights.
    - If user select part of the text inside a highlighted block, try to find the whole highlighted text block and then act as user select the whole block.
- What happens when user tries to highlight text that spans multiple paragraphs or includes special formatting?
    - simply treat all the selected text as a whole block.
- How does the plugin behave when the maximum number of custom colors is reached? 
    - User can add no more than 10 custom colors in the setting page.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to select text in the Obsidian editor
- **FR-002**: System MUST display a context menu when user right-clicks on selected text
- **FR-003**: System MUST show available highlight colors as menu items in format "Highlight with [color name]"
- **FR-004**: System MUST apply HTML markup around selected text to create colored background highlight
- **FR-005**: System MUST include an "Erase highlight" option in the context menu
- **FR-006**: System MUST remove highlight markup when "Erase highlight" is selected on highlighted text
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide  predefined highlight colors: red, yellow, lightgreen
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow users to add custom colors through the plugin settings page
- **FR-009**: Custom colors MUST be persistently stored and available across Obsidian sessions
- **FR-010**: System MUST display color names or identifiers in the context menu for each highlight option
- **FR-011**: Highlights MUST be visible in both edit and reading modes of Obsidian
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle color format - hex codes, RGB values, or color names for custom colors
- **FR-013**: System MUST validate custom color inputs to ensure they are valid color values
- **FR-014**: System MUST allow users to manage custom colors in settings

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Highlight Color**: Represents a color option available for highlighting, includes color value and display name, can be predefined or user-defined
- **Highlighted Text Segment**: Represents a portion of text with applied highlight markup, maintains relationship to its color
- **Plugin Settings**: Stores user preferences including custom color definitions and potentially display preferences
